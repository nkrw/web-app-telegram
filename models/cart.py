# cart is a container for unsold items to collect items from different (sub-)categories
# to be able to checkout this cart at once together with a shipment fee. Only the
# quantity, category, subcategory is stored because the unique item is not yet sold
#
# note that the item is NOT reserved or blocked so that the availability of the item
# needs to be checked again during checkout
